# Git Workflow Setup

## Initial Authentication (One-Time Setup)

You need to authenticate with GitHub once. Choose one method:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "sf-imessage-bridge"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
5. Copy the token
6. Run: `git push origin main`
7. When prompted:
   - Username: `tctx`
   - Password: paste your token

The token will be saved in macOS Keychain for future use.

### Option 2: GitHub CLI
```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

### Option 3: SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:tctx/sf-imessage-bridge.git
# Then add GitHub to known hosts:
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
git push origin main
```

## Using the Workflow

Once authenticated, you can simply say:
- **"commit and push this code"** - I'll commit all changes and push
- **"commit and push with message 'fix typing indicator'"** - Custom commit message

Or use the helper script directly:
```bash
./git_push.sh "Your commit message here"
```

## What Gets Committed

- ✅ All code files
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Scripts
- ❌ `.env` files (excluded by .gitignore)
- ❌ Log files (excluded)
- ❌ `venv/` directory (excluded)
- ❌ State files like `bridge.lock` (excluded)
